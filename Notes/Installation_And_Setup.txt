Prisma Documetation

=> Install -  npm install prisma @prisma/client   
=> After then Prisma Folder Structure.
	- Basically for configuration you we need create Prisma folder at root directory
	- In that folder create schema.prisma file
	- This file contains your connection code and all models code
	- Connection Code - generator client{
				   	provider = "prisma-client-js"
				}

			   datasource db{
  				  provider = "mysql"
  				  url = env("DATABASE_URL")
			       }

	- If you want to create table then you need to create Model in same file i.e., schema.prisma
	
		model Profile {
		  id     Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
		  bio    String?
		  userId Int   
		}
=> After entering your model code then wee need to fire one command for migrate data from ORM to MySQL
	- npx prisma migrate dev --name init  
	- This creates tables according to your given model.
	- After applying this command in our Prisma folder one migration folder creates and in that folder all your transactions are created.

=> When we have to use this model/table then just import PrismaClient from PrismaClient and create object of PrismaClient
	- const {PrismaClient} =require("@prisma/client")
	  const prisma=new PrismaClient()

=> And that's it. Now you will able to access your models through this prisma like this
	- const response = await prisma.student_Info.create({
            data:{
                name:name,
                lastName:lastName
            } 
        })
